<h2>Using Code Templates</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Source Editor has a set of customizable code templates
for common snippets of C and C++ code. The code templates are
assigned abbreviations to identify them. You type an abbreviation
in your source file, press the Tab key, and the code snippet
from the template is inserted in the file. You can modify, create,
or remove code templates.
</p>
<p>
    <b>To insert a code snippet from a template:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Type the abbreviation for the code template and then press the
Tab key to generate the full code snippet.<br>
For example, you can type <tt>iff</tt>, followed by Tab, to
automatically generate <tt>if () {}</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>To view all the defined code templates:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Choose Tools &gt; Options &gt;.
    </li>
    <li>Click Editor and select the Code Templates tab.</li>
    <li>Select the language you are working with to view the code templates.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><b>
To customize the list of code templates:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
Choose Tools &gt; Options.
</li>
<li>
Click Editor and select the Code Templates tab.
</li>
<li>Select the language of the code templates you want to customize.
</li>
<li>If you want to change a code template, select a code template from
list and edit the Expanded Text field in the bottom panel.
</li>
<li>
If you want to add a new code template, click New.
</li>
<li>You can use the Expand Template On list to change the
    key or key combination that expands the abbreviations.
    By default, abbreviations are expanded when you press Tab. The
    Expand Template On list also contains the options of Space,
    Shift-Space, and Enter.</li>
</ol>

<!-- <li>
Type the first few characters of the template, press Ctrl-Spacebar,
and select the code template from the code completion box.
For example, to generate <tt>for (int i = 0; i &lt; ; i++) {}</tt>,
you can type <tt>fori</tt>, press Ctrl-Spacebar, press the down
arrow key twice, and press Enter.
</li>
<p>
To keep a code template abbreviation from expanding into the full
code snippet, type Shift-Spacebar after typing the abbreviation.
</p>
-->
<!-- <p>
There are also multi-line templates that provide the following
benefits:
<ul>
<li>
You can navigate between variables in the code snippet by pressing
the Tab key.
</li>
<li>
When you fill in the first occurrence of a variable name that needs
to be repeated in the snippet, the variable is filled in
automatically in the other places.
</li>
<li>
If the IDE detects that you have declared a variable that might be
relevant to the code snippet, the IDE fills in that variable for you.
</li>
</ul>
