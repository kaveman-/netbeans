    <p>
       The IDE provides support for generating and executing unit tests based on its own simple
      test framework, the CUnit framework, and the CppUnit framework. The CUnit and CppUnit
      frameworks are open source products that support development of tests for C and C++ and
      provide harnesses for running the tests.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE supports CUnit and CppUnit unit testing if the frameworks are separately installed
      on your system.
    </p>
    <p>
       For more information about downloading and using CUnit, see:

       The Simple tests use the IDE's own simple framework for running tests.
    </p>
    <h3>
       C/C++ Test Types in the IDE
    </h3>
    <p>
       You can use the IDE to create the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Simple C&nbsp;Tests</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Simple C++&nbsp;Tests.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CUnit Tests</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CppUnit Tests</b>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       You can generate tests by right-clicking a source file in the Projects window and selecting
      Create Test.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Unit Test Structure
    </h3>
    <p>
       The IDE stores unit tests as subfolders of the <tt>test</tt> folder, by default. You can
      specify a different name if you want as you create the tests.
    </p>
    <p>
       Each managed project has a default test logical folder that is used to store the unit tests.
      This folder is displayed as the Test File node in the Projects window. You can add any number
      of test folders to your project.
