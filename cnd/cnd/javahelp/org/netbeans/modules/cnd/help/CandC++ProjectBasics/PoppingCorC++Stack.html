<h2>Popping a Call From the Call Stack
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>You can change the execution of your program so that the next statement to be
executed is one of the calls made earlier on the stack. In general, popping, or
removing, a call from the call stack does not undo any effects that the call
caused. For example, if a call opened a database connection and then that call
is removed, the database connection will remain open.
</p>
<p>You can only pop a call if the program being debugged is paused.
</p>
<p>To make a frame in the call stack the current frame:
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the frame in the Call Stack window and choose Make Current.
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To remove a series of frames from the call stack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click a frame in the Call Stack window and choose Pop To Here.
Frames are removed from the stack. Program execution resumes at the beginning of
the line in the new current frame.
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To pop the most recent call from the call stack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click in the Call Stack window and choose Pop Topmost Call.
<p>The call is removed from the call stack. The program counter is moved to the
line before the instruction that made the removed call. If the source code is
available, the focus of the Source Editor is set to that line. When you continue
program execution, the call is repeated.
</p>
