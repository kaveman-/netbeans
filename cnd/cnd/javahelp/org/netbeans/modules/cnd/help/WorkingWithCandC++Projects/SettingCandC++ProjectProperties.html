<h2>Setting Project Properties</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>When a C or C++ project is created, it has a Debug configuration and a Release configuration. 
    A configuration is a collection of settings used for the project. You can easily switch many
    settings at once when you select a configuration. </p>
<p>
   In the Project Properties dialog box, you can modify Build properties such as the Tool Collection
   to use for building the project, options
   for compiler, linker, and packaging and other options for running, debugging, and
   so on.  The changes you make apply to the active configuration,
which you can select at the top of the Project Properties dialog box. You can apply the
changes to all configurations by selecting the configuration named &lt;All Configurations&gt;.
</p>
<p><b>To modify a project configuration property:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the main node of the project and choose Properties, or select the project and choose File &gt; Project Properties.</li>
<li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the configuration for which 
you want to set a property.  </li>
<li>Select a node in the left panel and 
modify the property using the text fields, drop-down lists, checkboxes, and 
buttons in the right panel.
</li>
<li>Click Apply to save the changes.</li>
</ol>
