<h2>Refactoring Inline</h2>
<p>With inline refactoring, you can replace macros with actual values.
    This is useful if a macro is only used one time in a project, for example.</p>

<table summary="Descriptions of Inline refactoring options." border="1" width="100%" frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<col width="24%" />
<col width="*" />
