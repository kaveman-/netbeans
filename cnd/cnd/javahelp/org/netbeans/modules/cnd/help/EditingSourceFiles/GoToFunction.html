<h2>Going to a Symbol</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p> 
<p>The Go to Symbol dialog box lets you find a symbol such as a function,
    constant, or variable by its name or prefix. The search is performed on all open projects.
</p>
<p>To go directly to the declaration of a symbol, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Choose Navigate &gt; Go To Symbol.</li>
<li>In the Go to Symbol dialog box, type a character
string or a regular expression in the Symbol Name field. Classes,
structs, enums, functions, unions, and namespaces that match the 
string are displayed in the Symbols Found list.</li>
<li>You can constrain the search by selecting the Case 
Sensitive check box.
</li>
<li>Select an item in the Symbols Found list and click OK, or double-click
    the item. The Source Editor displays the declaration of that symbol.
</li>
</ol>
