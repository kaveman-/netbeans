    <p>
       The Make panel lets you specify properties for building a C/C++ project from existing
      sources.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Working Directory.</b> By default, the IDE uses the run directory as the working
      directory when running build and clean commands for your project from existing sources. You
      can specify a different working directory for the IDE to use.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Build Command.</b> By default, the IDE uses the make command to run the default target in
      the unmanaged project's Makefile. With the Build Command property you can specify a different
      command for the IDE to use instead of make. The IDE runs the command as <tt>/bin/sh -c
      "command"</tt> which enables you to use any shell syntax including redirection and pipes.
      Type the command in the Build Command field the same way you would run it from the command
      line. For example, you could type <tt>my-script -opt1 -opt2</tt> to run a script and specify
      two options, or <tt>mycommand &gt; output.log</tt> to run your command and send the output to
      a logfile. The Build Command history is not maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Clean Command.</b> By default, the IDE uses the make command to run the clean target in
      the unmanaged project's Makefile. With the Clean Command property you can specify a different
      command for the IDE to use instead of make clean. As with the Build Command, you can use any
      command you could type in a command line. The Clean Command history is not maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Build Result.</b> The path to the output of the build, which is specified in the
      Makefile. You can specify a path to override that path specified in the Makefile.
