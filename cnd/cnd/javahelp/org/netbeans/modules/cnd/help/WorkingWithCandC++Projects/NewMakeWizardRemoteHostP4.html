<h2>New C/C++ Project With Remote Existing Sources Wizard: Select Mode</h2>
 <a href="#seealso"><small>See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>

<p>In the Select Mode page, you specify how the IDE should configure the project.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Specify the folder that contains existing sources.</b>  Type the path
    or browse to the directory. You can specify either the top directory, or a <tt>src</tt>
subdirectory.
    </li>
    <li><b>Specify the folder to store your project metadata.</b> Type the path or browse to the
directory.</li>
    <li><b>Build Host.</b>  The default build host is pre-selected but you
    can change to another host if you have configured remote build hosts.</li>
    <li><b>Tool Collection.</b>  The default tool collection is pre-selected
    but you can change it is you have configured more than one tool collection.</li>
    <li><b>Select Configuration Mode.</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Automatic.</b>  Lets the IDE automatically configure
    the project based on an existing makefile. If the project uses a GNU build
    system <tt>configure</tt> script, or is
    is configured to use CMake or QMake, the IDE runs the appropriate commands
    to generate the makefile. Note that when the IDE configures the project
    automatically, it automatically runs the clean and build targets that are
    specified in the makefile.  You should not choose Automatic if you have built
    binaries in your source folder that you want to keep.</li>
    <li><b>Custom.</b> Lets you determine how the project is configured, prompted
        by more dialogs. You can disable the automatic clean and build and
        specify other options.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
