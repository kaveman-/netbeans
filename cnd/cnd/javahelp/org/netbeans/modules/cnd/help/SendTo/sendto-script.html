    <h2>
       SendTo Scripts
    </h2>
    <p>
       A SendTo script is a script that is executed when it is selected from the Send To menu. A
      script can act on selected files or selected test.
    </p>
    <p>
       A script can be written in any scripting language that is supported on your system. You can
      specify the executor to be used to execute the script. The default executor is
      <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
       A script that acts on selected files requires full paths to all selected files as its
      parameters. The script's output is written to a tab in the Output window. The script is
      running under terminal emulation (if available for the system). User input is supported.
    </p>
    <p>
       A script that acts on selected text cannot have any arguments. The text selected in the
      Source Editor is written to the script's standard input stream. The script's output is
      written to a tab in the Output window. No user input is supported for this type of script.
    </p>
    <p>
       You can run up to five scripts in parallel. You can interrupt a script's execution by
      clicking the Stop button <img alt="Stop button" src="../images/stop_script.gif">&nbsp;on the
      script's tab in the Output window.
    </p>
    <p>
       A script is considered to run successfully if and only if its exit status is 0. Output tabs
      for successfully run scripts are reused on subsequent invocations.
