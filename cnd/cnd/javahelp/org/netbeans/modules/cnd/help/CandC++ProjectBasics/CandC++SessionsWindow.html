<h2>C and C++ Sessions Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The Sessions window lists the debugging sessions currently running
in the IDE. When you start a second debugging session, the window opens automatically.
You can open the Sessions window by choosing Window &gt;
Debugging &gt; Sessions. If you open the Sessions window when a
debugging session is running, it closes automatically when you end
the debugging session. If you open the window when no debugging
session is running, it stays open until you close it.
</p>
<p>
The information given for each session includes the session name
and state. In most cases, the state corresponds to the state of the
process associated with the session. One session is always
considered the current session, unless no sessions are running. By
default, the current session is the session that you most recently
started.
</p>
<p>By default, the window displays the name, process ID, process state,
and host for each session. To display additional information, click the
Change Visible Columns button <img src="../images/visibleColumns.png" alt="Change Visible Columns icon">&nbsp;and
select columns in the Change Visible Columns dialog box.
</p>
