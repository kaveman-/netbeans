<h2>Organizing C/C++ Breakpoints Into Groups</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Breakpoints window lists all breakpoints defined for your open IDE projects.
    If you have numerous breakpoints you might find it helpful to view the breakpoints in groups. You can
also perform actions on multiple breakpoints at once.</p>
<p>You can group breakpoints using several different categories:  per file,
per project, by type, by language, by debug session. You can also group them in
multiple nested categories, or create custom groups. By default you only view the
breakpoints for open projects, but you can change this to you see all breakpoints for all your projects.</p>
<p> <b>To view breakpoints in groups:</b> </p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose Windows  &gt; Debugging
       &gt; Breakpoints (Alt-Shift-5)
      to open the Breakpoints window.
  </li>
  <li>Click the Select Breakpoint Groups icon in the left margin, and select the category to use for grouping breakpoints.
  <p>The breakpoints are arranged according to your selection. You can select the breakpoints as a group and enable, disable, and delete them as a single
	unit.</p>
  </li>

</ol>
<p> <b>To view breakpoints in multiple groups:</b> </p>
<ol>
 <li>Click the Select Breakpoint Groups button in the left margin, and select Nested.
 <li>In the Nested Breakpoint Groups window, select categories shown in Available Groups and click Add to move
 them to Displayed Groups.</li>
 <li>Set the order in which you want the groups to be displayed by selecting items in Displayed Groups and clicking
 the Move Up and Move Down buttons.</li>
 <li>Click OK.
  <p>The breakpoints are arranged in nested groups according to your selection. You can select the breakpoints as a group and enable, disable, and delete them as a single
	unit.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><b>To delete all breakpoints in a group:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Breakpoints window, right-click the top line of a breakpoint group and select Delete All Grouped.

  	<p>The IDE removes all breakpoints in the group.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To see all breakpoints in all projects:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Click the Select Breakpoint Groups button in the left margin and deselect the option From Open Projects Only.
        <p>All breakpoints are displayed but you can group them to make them easier to manage.</p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul class="note">
    <li>Right-click any breakpoint group to run commands such as Enable and Disable
      on all of the breakpoints in the group.</li>
  </ul>
