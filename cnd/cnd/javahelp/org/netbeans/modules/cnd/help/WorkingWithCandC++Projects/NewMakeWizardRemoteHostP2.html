    <ul>
<li><b>Identification.</b> In the Login field, enter the user name that you use to log in to the remote host and click Next.
    </li>
    <li><b>Authentication.</b> Select a method for authenticating
        to the host.
    <ul>
<li><b>Password.</b> Select this option to be prompted to enter your password
        when the IDE connects to the host.</li>
    <li><b>SSH Key File.</b> Select this option to use a authentication key to connect to the host.
    The keypair must already have been set up appropriately on the local client and remote host before
    the IDE can use the SSH private key. You can browse to the location where the keys are stored and select the private
    key you want to use.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Click Next after making your selection.</p>
    <p>If you selected Password, you are prompted to enter your password. If you selected
        SSH key, you might be asked to confirm the RSA key fingerprint of the server if this
        is the first time you have connected to the server using the key.</p>

    <p>The IDE then connects to the remote host,
    determines the host's platform, and searches for tool collections on your path on the remote host.
    When this process is complete, the <a href="NewMakeWizardRemoteHostP3.html">Summary page</a>
    is displayed.</p>
