    <p>
       Set these options for C/C++ code completion in the Options &gt; Editor &gt; Code Completion
      tab, when C/C++ Source Files is selected in the Language list. These options apply globally
      to C/C++ projects, and only to C/C++ projects.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Auto Popup Triggers for C/C++&nbsp;Identifiers.</b> When you type the symbols shown in
        this field, the editor&nbsp;opens a popup completion window to enable you to select an
        identifier from a list. The symbols &nbsp;<code>,-&gt;::</code> &nbsp;are the default
        triggers, and you can add or remove symbols.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Auto Insert #include Directives for Completed Identifiers.</b> If you select this
        option, the editor&nbsp;automatically inserts the appropriate #include directive required
        for an identifier you selected from a code completion popup window. This option is enabled
        by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Auto Popup Triggers for #include Directives.</b> Specify the characters that,&nbsp;when
        typed after the #include directive, cause the popup completion window to display a list of
        headers files. If you type a double-quotation mark (") a completion popup of header files
        from your project displays. If you type a left-angle bracket&nbsp;(&lt;) the completion
        popup shows header files that are on the compiler search path. This option is enabled by
        default.
