       C/C++ Project Properties Dialog Box: Run

    </p>
    <p>
       The Run panel lets you specify properties that are used when you run your project in the
      IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Run Command.</b> Enter a command to be executed when you run the project. The IDE runs
       the command as <tt>/bin/sh -c "run-command"</tt> which enables you to use any shell syntax including
       redirection and pipes.  Type the command in the Run Command field the same way you would run it from the command
       line. For example, you could type <tt>my-script -opt1 -opt2</tt> to run a script and specify
       two options, or <tt>mycommand > output.log</tt>  to run your command and send the output to a
       logfile. The Run Command list maintains history of previous entries so you can go back to the
       default value or select among several different commands you have entered.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Run Directory.</b> Enter the path to the directory where the project should run. Normally
      this is the same as the project directory.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Environment.</b> Enter any environment variables and their values if the project requires
      them to run.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Build First.</b> Select the checkbox if you want the project to build before it runs.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Console Type.</b> The output generated when you run the project goes to the console. You
      can specify what type of console to use.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Standard Output sends the program's output to the Output window in the IDE. This causes the
        build output to be replaced with the run output.
      </li>
      <li>
        External Terminal causes the IDE to open a new terminal window outside the IDE to display
        the program output and allow you to type input to the program.
      </li>
      <li>
        Internal Terminal causes the IDE to open a new tab in the Output window,
        to display the program output and allow you to type any input.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>External Terminal Type.</b> This option is enabled if you set Console Type
       to External Terminal. The terminal choices offered in the list vary according to the
      environment where the IDE is running.
