       The Pre-Build panel lets you specify properties for activities required before building a
      C/C++ project from existing sources.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Working Directory.</b> By default, the IDE uses the run directory as the working
      directory for running a configure script or other pre-build command for your project from
      existing sources. You can specify a different working directory for the IDE to use.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Command Line.</b> The command that the IDE needs to run. Use the same command syntax and
      arguments you would use if running the command in a shell.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Pre-Build First. &nbsp;</b>Select the checkbox to run this command before building the
      project.
