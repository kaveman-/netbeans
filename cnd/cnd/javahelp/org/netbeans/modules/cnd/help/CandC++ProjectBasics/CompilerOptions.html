       Setting C and C++ Compiler Options
    </h2>

    <p>
       When you create a C or C++ Application or Library project, the IDE generates a master
      makefile and configuration-specific makefiles that control all aspects of project
      compilation. You can set the compiler options for your project or a file in the project using
      the Project Properties dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To set compiler options:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Right-click the project node or file node and choose Properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Project Properties dialog box, select the configuration for which you want to set
        compiler options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Expand the Build node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the compiler node and then modify the compiler properties.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       All changes are immediately registered in the makefiles when you click OK. In most cases,
      the properties are translated to compiler flags in the makefiles.
