       Current Context in the Debugger
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       The current context is the portion of your program on which the debugger is currently
      focusing. When multiple sessions are running, only one session is current.
      <!--Within the current session, the thread
      from which the debugger regained control is the default current
      thread. Inside the current thread, the most recent call is the
      default current call.
      -->
    </p>
    <p>
       You can make any session or call current by right-clicking its node in the appropriate
      debugger window and choosing Make Current.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Debugger Windows and Context
    </h3>
    <p>
       Most debugger windows depend on the current context. When you change the current context,
      the contents of these windows are updated to reflect the new context.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, the Call Stack window shows the call stack for the current thread and the
      Variables window shows the variables that are local to the current call.
    </p>
    <p>
       The exceptions are the Breakpoints and Watches windows. These windows list all breakpoints
      and watches set in the IDE. While the set of watches is shared by all sessions, an individual
      watch expression is evaluated and displayed based on the current context.
    </p>
    <h3>
       The Source Editor and Context
    </h3>
    <p>
       When a variable is active in the current context, the Source Editor displays the value of
      the variable when you move the pointer over it. In cases where a program includes different
      variables with the same name, the Source Editor displays the value based on the current
      context, and not on the instance of the variable in the source code.
