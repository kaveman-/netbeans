<h2>New C/C++ Project from Binary File Wizard: Select Binary File</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The New Project From Binary File Wizard lets you create a project
from an existing binary file. In the Select Binary File page,
you specify the binary file, the location of the source files
from which it was built, which files you want included in the project,
and whether you want dependencies included in the project.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Binary File.</b> Type the path name of the binary
file from which you want to create a project, or click the
Browse button and browse to the file.</li>
<li><b>Sources Root.</b> The root directory for the source
files from which the binary was built is filled in automatically.
If the wizard cannot determine the sources root, you can type it
in or click Browse to browse to the directory.
</li>
<li><b>Include into Project.</b> By default, only the source files
from which the binary was built are included in the project. If
you want the project to include all of the files in the source
root directory, select All Files under Source Root from the drop-down
list.
</li>
<li><b>Dependencies.</b> The default setting is Include
Dependencies into the Project. You can use the drop-down list
to select Do Not Include Dependencies or Create Separate
Projects for Dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shared libraries required by the project are automatically
listed.</p>
<p>Click Next.</p>
