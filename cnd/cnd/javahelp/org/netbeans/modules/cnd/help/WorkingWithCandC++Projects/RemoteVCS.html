       Using Full Remote Mode with Version Control Systems
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE offers three modes of remote development described in
       <a href="RemoteModes.html">C/C++ Remote Development Modes</a>.
   </p>
    <p>
       When you use full remote development, the source files reside on the
       remote host. The IDE enables you to use Git, Mercurial, and Subversion
       version control systems (VCS)
            in full remote mode on the remote source files.</p>
    <p>After you configure the IDE for your remote projects, you can configure the VCS settings
    for the remote projects.</p>
    <p>
       <b>To specify VCS settings for full remote projects:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the IDE menu bar, choose Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences
        on OS X) to display the Options dialog.
      </li>
      <li>Select the Team category and then click the Versioning tab.</li>
      <li>
        In the Versioning Systems list, select the remote VCS you want to work with.
        <ul>
            <li>Remote Git: Specify the options for using Git on the remote source files. They are
                    the same as the Git options for local projects. For more information see the
                    NetBeans document  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=nb8000&id=NBDAG272">
                        How to Set Git Global Options</a> which you can view in a web browser.
            </li>
            <li>Remote Mercurial: Select the build host, and specify the Mercurial
                username to use with remote projects you work with on the host.
               Type or browse to the Mercurial executable file path on the build host. You should
                not include the executable itself (for example the hg command) in the path.
                For more information see the NetBeans document
                    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=nb8000&id=NBDAG318">Versioning
                    Applications with Mercurial</a> which you can view in a web browser.
           </li>
           <li>Remote Subversion: Select the build host and
               type or browse to the Subversion executable file path on the build host. You should
                not include the executable itself (for example the svn command) in the path.
                For more information see the NetBeans document
                    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=nb8000&id=NBDAG274">Versioning
                    Applications with Subversion</a> which you can view in a web browser.</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click OK.</li>
      <li>
        Work with your projects with the VCS just the same as local projects.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>To set colors used in the IDE for VCS information highlighting:</b></p>
    <ol> <li>
        In the IDE menu bar, choose Tools &gt; Options (NetBeans &gt; Preferences 
        on OS X) to display the Options dialog.
      </li>
      <li>Select the Fonts &amp; Colors category and then click the Versioning tab.</li>
      <li>In the Versioning Systems list, select the remote VCS you want to work with.
</li>
<li>Select the highlighting category, choose colors as you like, then click OK.</li></ol>
