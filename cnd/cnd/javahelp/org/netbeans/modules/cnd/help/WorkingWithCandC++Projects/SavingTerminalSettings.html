    <h2>
       Pinning a Terminal
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       You can save settings for a terminal session for a local or remote host by pinning it
       and specifying a title and a working directory when prompted. Thereafter,
       each time you open a terminal the IDE uses these settings for the terminals
       even if you have restarted the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>The terminal window must already be open on the local host, or connected
        to a remote host before you pin it. The IDE enables you to specify a custom
    title and the current working directory for the pinned terminal.</p>
    <p>
       <b>To pin a terminal window:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
          Open a terminal window as described in <a href="RemoteDevelopmentTerminal.html">
              Opening a Terminal Window for a Build Host</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click inside the terminal window and choose Pin Tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Pin Tab dialog, select the Custom checkbox if you want to set the title,
        and type a new title.
      </li>
      <li>In the Directory field, type the path that you want to use as the current working directory
      when this terminal starts.</li>
      <li>Click OK.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The hostname, terminal title, and working directory are saved in your user settings
        so that the IDE can reuse them when you open a terminal window. </p>
    <p>When you no longer want to use these settings, you can unpin the terminal.</p>
    <p>
       <b>To unpin a terminal window:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>
        Right-click inside the terminal window and choose Unpin Tab.
        <p>The IDE deletes the saved settings so that when you start a terminal
            it will not use the hostname, title, and working directory you
            had previously set.</p>
      </li>
