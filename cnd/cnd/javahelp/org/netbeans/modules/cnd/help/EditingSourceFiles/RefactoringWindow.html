<h2>Refactoring Window</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Refactoring window opens when you click Preview in the Rename dialog box.
On the left, the window shows a tree view of the occurrences in your project of the
element that
you are renaming. On the right is a split panel showing the selected source file and the
refactored source file on the right. You can deselect files in which you do not want
the name changed, or occurrences of the name you do not want changed, using the
checkboxes in the tree view.
</p>
<p>Buttons at the left side of the Refactoring window allow you to
change the display:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column lists
the button. The right column lists the description.">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Button</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
