<h2>C and C++ Debugger Windows</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
When you start a debugging session, the IDE opens debugging
windows below the editing area. The Watches, Variables, and Call Stack
windows open by default. Each debugger window has a tab and
shares space with the Output window. You can also open these windows
and other debugger windows by choosing Window &gt; Debugging &gt; window-name (for example,
Window > Debugging > Breakpoints).
</p>
<p>
Each debugger window shows lists of objects and properties of
the objects. Icons next to the objects relay
information about the object. For example, in the Breakpoints window
a small red square indicates a breakpoint set on a line. Some
windows also have controls to expand and collapse object nodes.
</p>
<p>
Some objects have editable properties, such as
the value property of a variable in the Variables window. If a
selected property has a white background, it is editable.
A selected property with a gray background cannot be edited.
</p>
<p>
You can resize columns in debugger windows by dragging the right edge
of the column header. You can move a column by dragging the middle
of the column header to a new location. Click the icon to the right of the column
titles to select which columns to show or hide.
</p>
<p>Right-click in a debugger window to display a pop-up menu of
    actions that apply to the objects in the window.
