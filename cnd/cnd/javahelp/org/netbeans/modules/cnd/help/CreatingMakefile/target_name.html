</small></p>
<p>The Enter Target Name page of the Makefile wizard is displayed only if you
are using one of the simple makefile templates. On the Enter Target Name page, you specify the directory
in which you want to store the files created by the build, and the name of the build target.
</p>
<p>
By default, the object files and other files that are created during the build
    are stored in a platform-specific subdirectory of your base directory to
    so that incompatible object files can coexist. </p>
<h3>Directory for All Created Files</h3>
<p>If you do not want the files created during the build
    stored in the default directory displayed in the text field,
    type the path or browse to the directory where
    you want to store the files.
<h3>Executable Name</h3>
<p>
Type a name for the target in the Executable Name text field and click Next.</p>
