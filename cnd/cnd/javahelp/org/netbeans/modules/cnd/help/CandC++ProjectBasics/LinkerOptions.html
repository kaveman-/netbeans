<h2>Setting C and C++ Linker Options</h2>
<p>When you create a C or C++ Application or Dynamic Library project, the IDE generates a
master makefile and configuration-specific makefiles that control all aspects
of program linking. You can set the linker options for your project using
the Project Properties dialog box. All changes are immediately registered in
the appropriate makefiles.
</p>
<p><b>To set linker options:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the project node and choose Properties.</li>
<li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the project configuration for
which you want to set linker options.
</li>
<li>Expand the Build node, then select the Linker node and modify the options.
The options are described in <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/ProjectPropsLinkerGeneral.html">
    C/C++ Project Properties Dialog Box: Linker</a>.</li>
</ol>
