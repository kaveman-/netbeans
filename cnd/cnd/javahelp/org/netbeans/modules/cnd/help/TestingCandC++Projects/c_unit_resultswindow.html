       Unit test results are displayed in the Test Results window. When you run a test, the IDE
      automatically opens the window and displays the results in two panels in the Test Results
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
       The right panel displays the console output from the tests.
    </p>
    <p>
       The left panel displays a summary of the passed and failed tests and the description of
      failed tests.
    </p>
    <p>
       You can do the following in the left panel of the Test Results window:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the filter button (&nbsp;<img height="18" width="20" alt="Filter icon" src=
        "../images/junit_filter.gif">&nbsp;) to switch between viewing all test results and viewing
        only the failed tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the up arrow and down arrow buttons to jump to each failed test in the Test Results
        window and in the editor.
      </li>
