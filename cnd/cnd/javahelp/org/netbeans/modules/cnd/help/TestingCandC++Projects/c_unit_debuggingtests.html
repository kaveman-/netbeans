       Debugging a C or C++ Unit Test

       You can start the debugger on unit tests in one of the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        After you run the project's tests, you can right-click a test in the <a href=
        "c_unit_resultswindow.html">Test Results window</a> and select Debug.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click the folder for the test suite and select Debug Test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click the folder for the test and select Step Into Test to debug the test one line at
        a time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The IDE runs the test in the debugger, enabling you to examine your tests for errors.
      Debugging tests works the same as <a href=
      "../CandC++ProjectBasics/DebuggingCorC++Project.html">Debugging C and C++ Projects</a>.
