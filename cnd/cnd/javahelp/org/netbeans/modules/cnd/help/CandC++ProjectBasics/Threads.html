<h2>Debugging Threads</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
</p>
<p>All the threads created in the current session are 
displayed in the Threads window. You can open the Threads window 
by choosing Window &gt; Debugging &gt; Threads. 
</p>
<h3>Changing the Current Thread</h3>
Only one thread is the current thread at any given time. By default, 
the current thread is the thread in the current session from which 
the debugger gained control. When you switch to a different thread to debug, 
the Call Stack window and Variables window are automatically 
updated to reflect the data applicable to that thread.
</p>
<p><b>To change the current thread in the Threads window:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the thread you want to make the 
current thread.
</li>
<li>Right-click a thread and choose Make Current.</li>
</ul>
