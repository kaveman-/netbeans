    <p>
       The Debug panel lets you specify properties that are used when you debug your project in the
      IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Debug Command.</b> For debugging, the IDE uses the command specified as the Run Command in the
      Run properties by default. You can specify a different command to be executed when you debug the project.
      The IDE runs the command as <tt>/bin/sh -c "debug-command"</tt> which enables you to use any shell syntax including
       redirection and pipes.  Type the command in the Debug Command field the same way you would run it from the command
       line. For example, you could type <tt>my-script -opt1 -opt2</tt> to run a script and specify
       two options, or <tt>mycommand > output.log</tt>  to run your command and send the output to a
       logfile. Unlike the Run Command, the Debug Command history is not maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Working dir.</b> By default, the IDE uses the run directory as the working directory when
      debugging your project. You can specify a different working directory for the IDE to use for
      debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Symbol file.</b> Specify a file containing a symbol table. By default the IDE
       assumes the symbols are in the output binary.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Gdb Init File.</b> By default, the IDE uses the <tt>.gdbinit</tt> file in your home
      directory. You can specify a different <tt>.gdbinit</tt> file for gdb commands to be executed
      before the debugging session starts.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Source dirs.</b> You can specify directories to be added to the beginning of the search
      path for source files.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Follow Fork Mode.</b> Specify whether to follow the parent or child process after a call
      to fork or vfork.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Detach On Fork.</b> Set to <b>on</b> to make the debugger detach from one process after it
      forks, or <b>off</b> to stay attached to both processes.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Substitute Path.</b> You can map your compile time and debug time file paths if they are
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Signals.</b> You can specify which signals the debugger should ignore.
