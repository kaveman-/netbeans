       Sharing Files With Remote Build Hosts
    </h2>

    <p>
       When you use a remote development host, the local and remote hosts both need to access the
      project files. This access can be accomplished through file sharing or securely copying the
      files. Before the IDE can use file sharing between the local and remote systems, the shared
      file system or folder must be set up and accessible to both systems. Remote files are
      accessed through SFTP or another file sharing mechanism available in the operating system the
      host is running, for example, Network File System (NFS), Samba, or WebDAV.
    </p>
    <p>
       If file sharing is not possible, use Automatic Copying&nbsp;to copy the files to the server
      using Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The files will be copied to a <tt>.netbeans/remote</tt>
      subdirectory located in your home user directory on the remote host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To set up the remote host to use existing network file sharing:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Services window, expand the C/C++ Build Hosts node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click the server you want to change and choose Properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Host Properties dialog box, select System-level File Sharing from the Access Project
        Files Via&nbsp;list
      </li>
      <li>
        Click OK.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       When you use the System-level File Sharing option for making project files available for
      local and remote build hosts, you might need to provide path mapping information to help the
      IDE use the shared file system.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To set the path mapping for a remote host that uses file sharing:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select Tools &gt; Options, and click the C/C++ category.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the Build Tools tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click Edit next to the Build Host list.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Build Hosts Manager dialog box, select the remote host that you have set up to use
        File Sharing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click Path Mapper...
      </li>
      <li>
        Double-click the text entry line under Local Path, and type the full path to the shared
        directory as seen from the local machine. For example, if you are storing your project in a
        <tt>/export/home/user/NetBeansProjects</tt> directory on <tt>myserver</tt>, you might
        access that directory as <tt>/Volumes/NET/myserver/export/home/user/NetBeansProjects</tt>
        on a Mac client. You can click the button next to the path field to use a file browser to
        navigate to the directory if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Double-click the text entry line under Remote Path and type the full path to the shared
        directory as seen from the remote host. If you use
        <tt>/export/home/user/NetBeansProjects</tt> from the remote server, enter that path as the
        Remote Path.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click OK in the Edit Path's Map dialog, and click OK in the Build Host Manager dialog.
      </li>
    </ol>
