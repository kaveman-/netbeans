<h2>Finding Class, Method, and Field Usages</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can use the Usages window to show you everywhere a class (structure),
function, variable, macro, or file is used in your project's source code.
</p>
<p><b>To find where a class (structure),
function, variable, macro, or file is used in your
project:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Source Editor, right-click the class, function, variable, macro, or file
and choose Find Usages.
</li>
<li>In the <a href="FindUsagesDialog.html">Find Usages dialog box</a>,
select options for the scope of the search. For a class, you can
choose to display all usages, all subtypes, or direct subtypes only.
</li>
<li>Click Find.
<p>A tab in the <a href="UsagesWindow.html">Usages window</a> displays the file name and the
lines of code for the usages found in that file.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For classes, the
Usages window displays all the code lines that use the type, or
use the type's members and static variables.
</p>
<p>For methods, the Usages window displays the code lines that call
the method.
</p>
<p>For fields, the Usages window displays the code lines that set
the field to a value or get the value of the field.
</p>
<p><b>To jump to a specific occurrence of the code element:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click a line of code to open the file and position the
cursor on that line of code.
</li>
