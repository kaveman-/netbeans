       Remote development enables you to run the IDE locally in your familiar desktop environment,
      while using the compute power and developer tools of a remote server to build your
      applications.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once the remote build host is configured and connected through the IDE, you can build, run,
      and debug projects as you normally do on your local system. The IDE runs the remote host's
      tools on your project files, enabling you to build binaries for the remote server platform.
      The remote host might also have more advanced hardware, such as multicore processors to
      enable fast parallel processing of your builds.
    </p>
    <p>
       When you use a remote build host, the local and remote hosts both need to access the project
      files. This can be accomplished through file sharing or securely copying the files. Before
      the IDE can use file sharing between the local and remote systems, the shared file system or
      folder must be set up and accessible to both systems. Remote files are accessed through SFTP
      or another file sharing mechanism available in the operating system the host is running, for
      example, Network File System (NFS), Samba, or WebDAV.
    </p>
    <p>
       If file sharing is not possible, you can use Automatic Copying option to copy the files to
      the server using SSH. The IDE manages the project files in both locations, so you do not need
      to transfer any files yourself. If a remotely built project generates files that are
      dependencies for the project, the IDE prompts you to download the generated files to the
      local system.
    </p>

       See <a href="RemoteModes.html">C/C++ Remote Development Modes</a> for more information about
      ways to do remote development.

       To use remote hosts for developing C, C++, or Fortran projects, you should perform the
      following tasks.
