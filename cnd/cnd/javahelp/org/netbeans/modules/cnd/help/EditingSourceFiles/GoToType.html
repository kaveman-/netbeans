<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Go to Type dialog box lets you find a type (class, struct, enum,
or typedef) by its name or prefix. The search is performed on all open projects.
</p>
<p><b>To go directly to a type:</b>
<ol>
<li>Choose Navigate &gt; Go To Type (Ctrl-O).</li>
<li>In the Go to Type dialog box, type a character string or regular expression
in the Type Name field. Types that match the string are displayed in the
Types Found list.</li>
<li>To constrain the search, select the Case
Sensitive check box.
</li>
<li>Double-click a type, or select a type in the Types Found list and click OK.
The Source Editor displays the declaration of that type.
