<h2>Using the SendTo Utility</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
<p>
The SendTo utility makes it easier to run any external
script on selected files from within the IDE.
</p>
<p>
You can use two types of scripts with SendTo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripts that act on selected files</li>
<li>Scripts that act on selected text</li>
</ul>
<p>
The utility includes a small set of pre-defined scripts that
you can modify to serve your particular needs. You can
also add new scripts.</p>
