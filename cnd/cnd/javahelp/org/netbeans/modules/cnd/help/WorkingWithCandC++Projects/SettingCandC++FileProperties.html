       Setting File Properties
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       When you set the project properties for your C or C++ project, the relevant properties apply
      to all folders and files in the project.
    </p>
    <p>
       By default, a file inherits the code assistance properties, include directories, preprocessor definitions, and
      C/C++&nbsp;standard&nbsp;from the project. You can set properties for one or several files independently.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To modify file properties:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Projects window, select one or more files whose properties you want to change. Press Shift 
        to select more than one.</li>
      <li>Right-click on the selected files and choose Properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the File Properties dialog box, select the configuration for which you want to set a
        property.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a node in the left panel and modify the property using the text fields, drop-down
        lists, check boxes, and buttons in the right panel.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       The General node shows the following properties for a specific file in addition to the name and file path:
    </p>
    <p><b>Has Code Assistance.</b> Indicates the code assistance state and is dynamically determined. </p>
    <p><b>Excluded From Build.</b> Select this option to prevent the file from building in the selected
        project configuration. </p>
    
    <p>See  <a href="ProjectPropsCompilerGeneral.html">C/C++ Project Properties Dialog Box: Compiler
          </a> for information about the Compiler node properties.</p>
