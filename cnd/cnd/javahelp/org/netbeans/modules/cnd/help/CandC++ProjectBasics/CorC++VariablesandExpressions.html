<h2>C and C++ Variables and Expressions in the IDE
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>In the IDE, static local and auto variables are listed in the Variables
window. However, you can also evaluate variables directly
in the Source Editor using <a href="BalloonEvaluation.html">balloon
evaluation</a>.
</p>
<p>
For each variable within the current function the Variables
window displays information including the variable name, type, and
value. The Variables window also displays all of the static
fields for each variable, as well as all of the inherited fields
from all superclasses.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, the debugger assigns a pound sign (#) and a number
as the variable's value. This number is a unique identifier of the
given instance. You can use this identifier to determine if a
variable points to the same instance or to a different instance.
You cannot edit this value.
</p>
<p>You can track the changes in the value of a variable during program
execution by setting a watch on the variable. When you create a
watch, the value of the variable is immediately evaluated and
displayed in the Watches window. You can also display watches in
the Variables window by clicking the <img src="../images/WatchesInVariables.png" alt="
                                          Watches in Variables button">&nbsp;
button on the left side of the window.
