ResolveBuildLibrary.Title.text=Resolve Build Issue
ResolveBuildLibrary.Explanation.text=IDE uses Smart Build analyzer to Configure Code Assistance.\n\
The error can be caused by resetting or unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in your build.\n\n\
To resolve the issue, you can do any of the following (listed in order of diminishing priority):\n\n\
1. Do not unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your build or modify it like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=user_path1:user_path2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n\n\
2. Unset LD_PRELOAD if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset in your build. Note that this disables Smart Build Analyzer.\n\n\
3. Press the Configure Smart Build Analyzer button below and deselect the Use Build Analyzer in Code Assistance node in Project Properties.
